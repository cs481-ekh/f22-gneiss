# Gneiss: Capstone Packet Management Web Application

## Abstract:
The Boise State University Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering (MBE) department seeks a means of integrating multiple aspects of their Senior Capstone Project lab equipment purchasing and invoicing process, to expedite repetitive tasks and streamline procurement. MBE uses a wide variety of documenting and logistical procedures in supporting the design of these capstone projects, consisting of numerous purchase invoices, spreadsheets, documents, and data from 3rd party applications. 

Much of this organization is currently managed by hand, a significant effort on the MBE department and its staff. Our project, 'Paketto', allows users to integrate many of these diverse sources of information into digital packets stored within a single web application. Paketto then organizes these packets within a database for easy access to purchasing information and invoices. This database is designed in a manner where it can be accessed in a secure manner through user accounts created through the application and administrated by the MBE department.

The aim of the project is to automate the process of storing and fetching contract information, create a more uniform means of organizing and presenting that information, and reducing the logistical burden involved in the procurement process, allowing for reduced effort on the part of the MBE department and its resources.

## Project Description:
PiRate uses a python based controller that will run security tests against a client computer from an externally connected Raspberry Pi. The tests have been structured according to the layout provided to you within our angular website's test upload page. With that said, the entire website is run using angular and is hosted on a node express server which will gather your IP address, as well as the directories that the tests reside in and any potential results from previous tests. After gathering this information it will get passed back to be viewed on the angular website and will update whenever a new test is added to the tests directory. The results of running tests can be saved to an external log file for later viewing, as well as the program remembering your device or being able to upload old test results.
